During the coronavirus pandemic Fifa agreed to extend substitutiones per game in Soccer,allowing up to 5 changes per time instead of 3.The aim of this proyect is to show if during the 2021 Uefa Champions League stage group the coaches 
keep using the 5 changes made available by Fifa during the 2020 or they went back to using 3 substitions per game as they used to.
The main hipothesis is that making 5 changes in an soccer game is almost as changing the 50% of the initial squad ,proving that the coach strategy before the game 
was not the righ one.
